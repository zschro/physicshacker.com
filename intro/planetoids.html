<p><H1>Introduction to Planetoids (Coordinate System)</H1>

<p>Below is the planetoids game that you will ultimately program in Lab 1. The purpose of this "introduction" is to emphasize that <b>the coordinate system is centered in the top left of the screen</b>. Therefore the origin x = 0, y = 0 is in the top left of the screen. It is also important to appreciate that <b>y increases towards the bottom of the screen</b>. This is why +y points down in the planetoids game below and +x points to the right like normal.

<p>This is reminiscent of falling object problems where downward motion is positive. Besides that everything is the same.
